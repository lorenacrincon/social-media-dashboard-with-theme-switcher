### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to customize classes in Tailwind from the tailwind.config.js file. I understood how Tailwind's dark mode works and practiced grid layout.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
